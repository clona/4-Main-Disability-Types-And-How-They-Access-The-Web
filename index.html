    <p class="body">Visually Challenged </p>
    <p class="body">Screen readers are the primary method of access for the visually challenged. It is software that people buy that reads aloud the information on a web page in a synthetic voice. 6 barriers of screen readers are: 1. $1,000 software. 2. System requirements. 3. Learning curve. 4. Sites that are not accessible. 5. Robotic voice. 6. Does not work on mobile devices.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="body">Auditorily Challenged</p>
    <p class="body">The auditorily challenged typically access audio on the web via captioning. This applies mostly to online videos. In fact this text is a form of captioning although it is integrated into this presentation whereas (see video). Most captioning is added after the fact. Barriers to access related to captioning are that often it is not available, it is an added production cost and does not always accurately show what is being said.</p>

  <div class="child">
    <p class="body">Physically Challenged</p>
    <p class="body">A person who cannot use a mouse must be able to use the keyboard to navigate a website. Something called an &quot;Access Key&quot; can be added to the code that enables navigation with a keyboard. Barriers to access for this method are that the code requires the visitor to use a combination of keys for it to work which vary depending on the browser being used.</p>
    <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="body">Cognitively Challenged</p>
    <p class="body">Even one of the leading organizations for web accessibility (Web AIM) says, &quot;Web accessibility for individuals with cognitive or learning disabilities is varied and complex. It is an area with little definitive research and few concrete recommendations.&quot; Barriers vary widely especially since there are &quot;few concrete recommendations.&quot;</p>
